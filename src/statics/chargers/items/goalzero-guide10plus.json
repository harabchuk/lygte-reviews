Here I am looking on a combined AA charger and power bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0260a.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0260.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0260\"> </a> <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0261a.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0261.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0261\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the charger on a piece of cardboard with a box for accessories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0274.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0274\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents of the pack: The charger, 4 2300mAh GoalZero cells, an instruction sheet, a short form instruction sheet, a inlay for AAA batteries, usb cable and a cable for GoalZero solar panels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0278.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0278\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll connections and user interface is placed at one end of the charger, they are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Red/green Led to show charge state, light patterns are explained on the bottom of the charger.\r\n</li><li>Switch to select mode: off/charge, power bank on, flashlight led on.\r\n</li><li>Power bank output usb connector.\r\n</li><li>Flashlight led, it is a white led.\r\n</li><li>Round solar panel power input connector.\r\n</li><li>Mini usb power input connector (This means cable cannot be with the mobil phone).\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0279a.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0279.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0279\"> </a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBottom of charger explains the led and a few other details, i.e. you got the important stuff from the manual here (Very nice).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0277.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0277\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end is a steel wire. It is possible to run a strap under it and tie the charger to the outside of a backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0280.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0280\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger has a lid, making it fairly easy to keep the batteries in the charger, even if it is on the outside of a backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0281.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0281\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0282.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0282\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slots are only designed for AA batteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0286.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0286\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0287.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0287\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0285.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0285\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the supplied inlay it can also be used for AAA batteries. I am not impressed with that solution, the inlay is a extra piece to lug around and it can easily get lost. I would be more correct to just call it a AA charger and forget about AAA cells.<br>\r\nThere is one more reason for that, the charger is a 4 cell charger, i.e. you cannot charge one or two cells. In practical applications it is most often one or two AAA cells, but frequently four AA cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0288.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0288\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supplied solar panel cable use some very small barrel connectors. The cable is rather thick.<br>\r\nTo test the solar input I cut this cable (To connect power to it) and was impressed with how much copper there is inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/supportedBatteryTypes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatteryTypes\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/supportedBatterySizes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatterySizes\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0284.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0284\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/DSC_0283.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_0283\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAAA requires inlay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Measurements charger</span><br>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Charges four cells in series.\r\n</li><li>Will discharge a full battery with less than 0.06mA\r\n</li><li>Charge function will also work with switch in power bank or flashlight position.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger stops a bit early, it looks like it is using voltage termination.<br>\r\nThe charger is charging with about 0.5A current, this means 4 to 5 hours charge time and not the 8 hours that the manual says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%200.5ohm%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%200.5ohm%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimulating a weak usb power supply will increase the charger time, but it is still way below the 8 hours.<br>\r\nNotice the usb current is exactly the same as above, it looks like the charger drains a constant current from the usb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xeneloopAAA).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xeneloopAAA)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger current for AAA is about the same as for AA cells, because the current is only 0.5A this is fine. These smaller cells will be charged much faster.<br>\r\nI have no idea why the charger takes a break just before it is finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xGoalZero).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(4xGoalZero)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe GoalZero batteries has a bit more capacity than my eneloops and takes longer to charger. Termination is the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(powerex+3xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(powerex+3xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manual says the batteries must be the same capacity, but not the same charge state, in this test I did not follow that, but used one 2500mAh cell and 3 2000mAh cells. The 3 low capacity cells got filled (mostly), but not the 2500mAh cell.<br>\r\nVoltage is the 2500mAh cell (powerex)<br>\r\nVoltage #2 is one of the 2000mAh cells (eneloop)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(eneloop+dummy).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20(eneloop+dummy)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manual says that the charger must always charge 4 cell, I did not follow that here. I have one eneloop in slot #1 and a dummy in slot #3. The charger can bypass empty slots with a lower current, but it will not terminate the charge<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20full%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20full%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets try the part about different charge state, I have one full cell (The one I am measuring on) and 3 empty cells.<br>\r\nThis is not very good, the full cell got nearly a complete charge again and the empty cells got slightly less charge than usual.<br>\r\nIt does not look like the charger has any individual check of the cells.<br>\r\nNote: The temperature sensor is on one of the empty cells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20full4%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20full4%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 4 full batteries there is no problem terminating in a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%206.5V%20(4xGoalZero).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%206.5V%20(4xGoalZero)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manual says the solar input needs 6.5 volt and can draw 1.5A, I can easily simulate that with a power supply.<br>\r\nThe charge current is increased, but not enough to get a 3 hours charge time, i.e. either the 3 hours are wrong or the solar panel delivers more voltage than 6.5 volt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/Temp2167.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Temp2167\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nM1: 32,1\u00b0C, M2: 48,9\u00b0C, M3: 34,4\u00b0C, M4: 39,1\u00b0C, HS1: 50,4\u00b0C<br>\r\nIt looks like all the charge electronic is placed very close to the power input connectors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/Temp2168.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Temp2168\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nM1: 45,9\u00b0C, M2: 49,1\u00b0C, HS1: 61,0\u00b0C<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/Temp2171.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Temp2171\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nM1: 34,8\u00b0C, M2: 34,4\u00b0C, M3: 33,7\u00b0C, M4: 32,6\u00b0C, M5: 49,1\u00b0C, HS1: 50,2\u00b0C<br>\r\nI charged with the lid closed, but opened it for this shot. The batteries stays very cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/Poweron.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Poweron\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is very fast to start (Voltage is across all 4 cells).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Measurements power bank</span><br>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Four AA cells in series are used for the power bank.\r\n</li><li>The flashlight led uses 26mA\r\n</li><li>When power bank function is turned on but idle, it will discharge batteries with 10mA\r\n</li><li>When flashlight is on, power bank function is off\r\n</li><li>Power bank function is on when charging, but at reduced power and up to 6 volt may be present.\r\n</li><li>Setting switch in power bank position will make the usb output work normally when charging.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20load%20sweep.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20load%20sweep\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe output voltage start a bit high and drops slowly with load, I did not find any overload protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/GoalZero/Guide10Plus/GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20usb%20out%2010ohm%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"GoalZero%20Guide10Plus%20usb%20out%2010ohm%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutput voltage is very stable with 0.5A load.

It works fine with a four battery set, i.e. if the batteries have been drained together, this charge can charge them.<br>\r\nAs a power bank it is fairly good, but it can only deliver about 1500mAh out at 1A.<br>\r\nIt is a nice little device, but I have some problems with seeing the usefulness of it, I want a charger that can handle one or two AA or AAA batteries and as a power bank it cannot match a LiIon based one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/usbPowerSupplyTestHow%20UK.html\">Read more about how I test USB power supplies and chargers</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
