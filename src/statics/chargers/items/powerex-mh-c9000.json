This charger has no fan and do get rather warm when charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Powerex%20MH-C9000%20charge%202A%2012V%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Powerex%20MH-C9000%20charge%202A%2012V%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current from the power supply is also pulsing, with an average current of about 1.5A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Charge%200.2A.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Charge%200.2A\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger uses pwm to adjust the charge current, each pulse is charging with 2A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Charge%201A.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Charge%201A\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor 1A charge this means 50% duty cycle. The duty cycle is not exactly 50%, but slightly below, this means that the charge current is slightly below 1A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Charge%202A.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Charge%202A\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at 2A the duty cycle is below 100% and this makes the current slight below 2A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Charge%20shorted%20battery.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Charge%20shorted%20battery\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the 2A charge pulse current due to a specific battery voltage or is it fixed. I uses a shorted battery and tried measuring the current again. It did not change, but was still 2A. This means the charger is using some sort of \"constant current\" circuit, not just a resistor for the charge current. This helps to limit the maximum current pulses. This is a good way to limit maximum current in pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/TopoffCharge.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"TopoffCharge\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top off charge looks like normal charging, but the pulses is shorter, the average current is about 0.1A and is applied for about 2 hours, i.e. about 200mAh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Trickle%20charge.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Trickle%20charge\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrickle charge uses the same 2A pulses, but they are even shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Trickle%20charge%20zoom.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Trickle%20charge%20zoom\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere I have zoomed in on a single trickle charge pulse. It is about 0.005 second long with 2A current and occur every other second, this gives an average of 5mA (The datasheet for the charger says 10mA). A nice low trickle current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Startup.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Startup\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a battery is put into the charger or it is powered on with batteries in it, it will start charging after some time.<br>\r\nIt starts by applying a 10 second high current pulse (This is always the case when charging is started), probably to check for alkaline batteries. If it registers to high voltage after that pulse the display will show \"HIGH\" and the charge will terminate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">REFRESH ANALYZE: NiMH single cycle</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mode will charge the battery, then discharge and finally charge again. Both the charge and discharge rate can be selected.<br>\r\nWhen finished the display will show the discharged capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Powerex%20MH-C9000%20refresh%201A%20(eneloop)%20%231.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Powerex%20MH-C9000%20refresh%201A%20(eneloop)%20%231\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs can be seen the charge cycles includes the top off charge and there is a rest after the discharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">BREAK-IN: NiMH Slow cycle</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreak-in will first charge the battery for 16 hours with 0.1C, then discharge the battery with 0.2C (This will take about 5 hours) and finally charge again with 0.1C for 16 hours. The capacity of the battery is selected from 0.5Ah to 20Ah in 0.1Ah steps. When finished the display will show discharged capacity. <br>\r\nThis method over charges the battery, before measuring capacity, this means it will always get the highest possible value. <br>\r\nThis method is used by IEC for measuring battery capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Powerex%20MH-C9000%20breakin%202000mAh%20(eneloop)%20%231.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Powerex%20MH-C9000%20breakin%202000mAh%20(eneloop)%20%231\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a slow procedure, taking about 39 hours. In this case here I started with a full battery, but it does still get the full 16 hour charge. It can be seen on the temperature curve when the battery is full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">DISCHG:: NiMH discharge</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDischarge will drain the battery, while measuring how much capacity was left in the battery. The discharge rate must be specified between 0.1A and 1A in 0.1A steps.<br>\r\nFor measuring the full capacity of a battery the \"REFRESH ANALYZE\" mode will often be more useful, because it includes charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Maha/Powerex%20MH-C9000/Powerex%20MH-C9000%20discharge%200.1A%20(4xeneloop).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Powerex%20MH-C9000%20discharge%200.1A%20(4xeneloop)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 0.1A discharge does not generate any heat.

With the top off charge it looks like the charger just fills the batteries.<br>\r\nThe function in the charger works very well and looks like they are designed for practical usage (i.e. they always shows the discharge capacity, not the charge capacity).<br>\r\nThe user interface on this charger is easy for normal charging of AA batteries (Just put the batteries in the charger, everything else is automatic), but for doing something more special it can require a lot of key presses for each battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is very good for analyzing batteries, but for normal charging the batteries might not always be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger was supplied by Danaco for review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
