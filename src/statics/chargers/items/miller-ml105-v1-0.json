Length must be between 64mm and 69.6mm, this means some protection cells will not fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/supportedBatteryTypes.png\"

alt=\"DSC_1371\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger can handle all unprotected 18650 and 26650 and many protected cells. <br>\r\nIt is possible to charge some smaller IMR (high current) cells on this charge by using a spacer, but check the charge specification for the cell first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Inside the charger</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img

apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/DSC_1762a.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/DSC_1762.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1762\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is not much electronic in the charger, only a buck converter for handling the charging and a couple of transistors.<br>\r\nThere are two leds in this charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/DSC_1763a.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/DSC_1763.jpg\" border=\"0\"

the charger will drain the battery with 0.05mA\r\n</li><li>This charge will not be able to reset battery protection.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<img

curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/Miller%20ML105%20(SA18650-26).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Miller%20ML105%20(SA18650-26)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img

3400mAh either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/Miller%20ML105%20(SH26650-35).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Miller%20ML105%20(SH26650-35)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 26650

alt=\"Miller%20ML105%20(BE18650-26)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn older cell makes the charge circuit a little bit unstable, but the cell is charged fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img

with the usb power supply to simulate a long cable or weak supply did not present any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/Temp2532.png\" border=\"0\"

src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20ML105/Startup.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Startup\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is a dumb charger, i.e. no microprocessor that needs to initialize or anything, when power is applied it will start charging immediately. This type of charger works perfectly with a solar panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is a good charger and with the spring in the back it can handle many xx650 cell, both protected and unprotected (Very long protected cells will not fit).<br>\r\nThe charger current is a bit above 1A, this is fine for most 18650 and all 26650 batteries, but a bit high for old 2900/3100mAh cells, if you have many of these cells and want to make the last as long as possible: use another charger. For other cells: enjoy the faster charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
