This is revision 3 of a four channel charger, lets see if everything is perfect this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: The <b>mix</b> version of this charger is covered in <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20Soshine%20SC-S1mix%20V3%20UK.html\">another review</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1775.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1775\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1777.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1777\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1779.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1779\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger arrives in a cardboard box, that does also work as manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1780.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1780\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nActual contents is the charger, a universal power supply (100-240 VAC 50/60Hz) and a car power adapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1785.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1785\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower input on the charger is a small DC connector, it need 12 volt 1.8A according to the label on the bottom of the charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1852.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1852\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom has the label and a lot of slots for air. The slots are not going to help much because the top of the charger does not have matching vents and when stuffed with batteries there is very little space around them (I did not notice any excess heating during tests).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1784.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1784\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger has 4 leds one for each channel, that can be either red or green.<ul>\r\n<li>Red: Charging.\r\n</li><li>Flashing green: nearly done charging.\r\n</li><li>Green: Battery fully charged.\r\n</li><li>Off: No battery, very low battery or reverse battery.\r\n</li><li>Flashing red/green: Non rechargeable.</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1787.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1787\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/DSC_1788.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1788\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe connections are slightly raised, i.e. it can charge flat top batteries.

At 225 minutes (Where the green current line gets thick), the charger starts flashing green, i.e. signally that the charger is nearly finished. This feature is very useful when short on time, as can be seen on the blue mAh curve there is very little capacity gain during the next 30 to 60 minutes, before the battery is full. I.e. removing the battery when the green led flashes will give nearly full capacity, but save 30 to 60 minutes in charging time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%232%20(PA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%232%20(PA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%233%20(PA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%233%20(PA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%234%20(PA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20%234%20(PA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 3 channels looks nearly equal to the first channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(4xPA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(4xPA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging on all four channels at the same time, does not reduce the charge current, i.e. it will charge four batteries just as fast as one battery.<br>\r\nThere is more noise in the charge current, showing that the internal regulator is working much harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(PA18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(PA18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 3100mAh battery is slightly faster to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(BE18650-26).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(BE18650-26)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down to 2600mAh reduces the charge time to 3\u00bd hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(AW16340-IMR).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20(AW16340-IMR)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger does also handle my old IMR cell, without any problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1max%20V3/Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20Startup.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Soshine%20S1max%20V3%20Startup\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis charger does not use softstart, but goes to full charge current shortly after power is connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting the mains transformer with 2500 volt and 5000 volt between mains and low volt side, did not show any safety problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis charger is not a charger with a lot of smart features, but for charging up to four 18650 batteries it does a very good job and the \"nearly finished\" indication on the leds is nice.
