It has two channels each with a voltmeter and 3 current settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1683.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1683\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1684.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1684\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1681.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1681\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1682.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1682\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes in a box made of plastic with a view to the charger and specifications on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1686.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1686\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the box is the charger, a power supply, a car adapter, a instruction sheet and a warranty card.<br>\r\nThe power supply I got was with US plug, but universal voltage (100-240VAC 50/60Hz).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1690.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1690\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger has a DC connector for power input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1691.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1691\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1693.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1693\"> <br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1694.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1694\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slots have raised battery connections, i.e. flat top batteries can be used. The slider works very smooth, with 16340 batteries the pressure is a bit low, but enough to get a connection. The maximum length is enough to take my longest battery, i.e. more than 70 mm. There is also a clear marking of polarity.<br>\r\nI will say that these slots work very well for the supported battery sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1692.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1692\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the top of the charger is a switch to select charge current, it can select between 0.25A, 0.50A and 1.00A, the current will be the same in both slots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1702.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1702\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1703.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1703\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1705.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1705\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display is the a new feature for Xtar and with the exception of <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/HobbyChargers%20UK.html\">hobby chargers</a>, I do not know of other chargers with this resolution.<br>\r\nEverything is, of course, shown on the display and not with leds: The voltage of each battery, the selected charge current and the charge state.<br>\r\nI have found two minor cosmetic details with the display. The first one is the background lightning, if the display is looked at from most angles it has a bright white border. The second detail is the \"charge finished\" signaling, there is no indicator to show when the charge is finished, you have to look at the fill state in the battery symbol, when all five bars are steady, the battery is finished. I would have preferred a more clear indication.<br>\r\nThe voltmeter has a good precision, when charging it will show slightly above the battery voltage, as expected. Sadly it will not really work above 4.20 volt (It will show one value and then stop updating).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1715.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1715\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXtar has recently started adding a product verification code to their equipment. This code can be verified on their website.<br>\r\nBut either my charger is a fake or there is some problem with the verifications system. My label has 3 groups of 6 digits, on the website you have to use 4 groups of 5 digits?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/supportedBatteryTypes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatteryTypes\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/supportedBatterySizes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatterySizes\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1706.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1706\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1707.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1707\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1708.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1708\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1709.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1709\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1710.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1710\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger can handle 70 mm long batteries, inclusive <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/Battery%20button%20or%20flat%20UK.html\">flat top cells</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Measurements</span><br>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Below 2.0 volt The charge current is between 2 and 3 mA.\r\n</li><li>Between 1.5 volt and 2.0 volt the battery symbol will flash.\r\n</li><li>Between 2.0 and 2.9 volt the charger current is about 42mA/42mA/72mA in the 3 current ranges.\r\n</li><li>Above 2.9 volt the regular CC/CV is used, see curve below.\r\n</li><li>Without power if will discharge the battery with about 0.5mA.\r\n</li><li>With power it will charge with about 0.5 mA when the battery is full.\r\n</li><li>Build in voltmeter is +0.015 volt at 0.25A\r\n</li><li>Build in voltmeter is +0.025 volt at 1.00A\r\n</li><li>The voltmeter can show voltages above 4.20 volt, but lock up and will not update anymore, before voltage is below 4.20 volt again.\r\n</li><li>The voltmeter will only be enabled with battery voltages above 1.5 volt.\r\n</li><li>Charge will restart if battery voltage drops to 3.9 volt.\r\n</li><li>The charger will restart when a battery is inserted or power is cycled.\r\n</li><li>Because each channel is independent, the different voltages varies between the channels with a small amount.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/ChargerXtar%20VP1%200.25A%20(PS18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"ChargerXtar%20VP1%200.25A%20(PS18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first charge curve is at the lowest charge current, it is a perfect CC/CV charge with termination at about 45mA.

There will be some voltage drop in the connection to the battery, this also means that the error will be less at lower charge currents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting the mains transformer with 2500 volt and 5000 volt between mains and low volt side, did not show any safety problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis charger does a perfect CC/CV, making it a fast charger or at least as fast as possible without cheating. With currents from 0.25 to 1A it covers many of the common batteries sizes, only exception is 26650 batteries and with a piece of tinfoil it is possible to charge one in the charger. I like the voltmeter, this makes it easy to see the charge state and also possible to spot a worn down battery.<br>\r\nI could have wished for a better \"finished\" indication and I would also like a larger range on the voltmeter, say from 0.00 volt to 4.35 volt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will rate this charger as very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this charger better than SP2? The charging is about the same, the advantages are from the voltmeter and from the lower charge current. The voltmeter is a nice feature for me, I am too lazy to check with a voltmeter each time I charge, now I can just look at the display. The 0.25A current makes it possible to charge 10440 cells and is slightly better for 16340 and some 14500 batteries. For me this makes the VP1 slightly better than SP2 and it will replace my SP2 as my most used charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor people that wants 4.20 volt on their batteries, this is not the charger, this charger uses the correct algorithm and the battery voltage will drop slightly below 4.20 volt when the charge is stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did all the tests at 110 VAC, because I bought the charger from US and got a US power supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>", "url": "https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20Xtar%20VP1%20UK.html", "preview": "https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Xtar/ChargerXtarVP1/DSC_1688.jpg", "title": "Xtar VP1", "slug": "xtar-vp1", "slots": 2, "slots_max_size": 2, "battery_len_min": 34, "battery_len_max": 71, "battery_d_min": 10, "battery_d_max": 18, "current_all": 1.0, "current_single_max": 1.0, "current_single_min": 0.25, "chemistry": ["LiIon 4.2V"], "power": ["12V", "Mains adapter included"], "extra": ["V"], "rating": 7, "year": 2013}
