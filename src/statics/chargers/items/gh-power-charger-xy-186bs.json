To avoid extra wear on the batteries due to that it is best to remove them from the charger within a few hours after charging is finished.<br>\r\nThe charge voltage is also at the maximum allowed for LiIon, this by itself it not a problem, but I wonder if some copies of the charger has too high voltage.<br>\r\nThe charger works very fine with unstable power supplies, i.e. a solar panel, but there is a single caveat: If the power disappears just before the battery is full, it will switch to trickle charge when the power returns, i.e. the battery will be slightly below a full charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a very cheap charger it works fine and I will rate it fairly good as 18650 charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger was supplied by a reader for review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/usbPowerSupplyTestHow%20UK.html\">Read more about how I test USB power supplies/charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>", "url": "https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20GH%20Power%20UK.html", "preview": "https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20GH%20Power/DSC_5372.jpg", "title": "GH Power Charger XY-186BS", "slug": "gh-power-charger-xy-186bs", "slots": 1, "slots_max_size": 1, "battery_len_min": 63, "battery_len_max": 68, "battery_d_min": 16, "battery_d_max": 18, "current_all": 1.0, "current_single_max": 1.0, "current_single_min": 1.0, "chemistry": ["LiIon 4.2V"], "power": ["USB"], "extra": [], "rating": 5, "year": 2019}
