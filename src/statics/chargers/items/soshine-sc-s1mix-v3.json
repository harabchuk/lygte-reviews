The slots are not going to help much because the top of the charger does not have matching vents and when stuffed with batteries there is very little space around them (I did not notice any excess heating during tests).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/DSC_2093.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_2093\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger has 4 leds one for each channel, that can be either red or green.<ul>\r\n<li>Red: Charging.\r\n</li><li>Flashing green: nearly done charging.\r\n</li><li>Green: Battery fully charged.\r\n</li><li>Off: No battery, very low battery or reverse battery.\r\n</li><li>Flashing red/green: Non rechargeable.</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/DSC_2089.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_2089\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two different slots. The short slots cannot slide fully back without some help.<br>\r\nMaximum length on the short slots is about 47 mm, i.e. they do not fit 14500.<br>\r\nMaximum length on the long slots is above 70mm, minimum is about 48 mm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/DSC_2216.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_2216\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/DSC_2092.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_2092\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe connections are slightly raised, i.e. it can charge flat top batteries.

At 200 minutes (Where the green current line gets thick), the charger starts flashing green, i.e. signally that the charger is nearly finished. This feature is very useful when short on time, as can be seen on the blue mAh curve there is very little capacity gain during until the charge is finished. I.e. removing the battery when the green led flashes will give nearly full capacity, and save some charging time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20%233%20(PA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20%233%20(PA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other slot works the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20(2xPA18650-34).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20(2xPA18650-34)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging both long slots at the same time, does not reduce the charge current, i.e. it will charge two batteries just as fast as one battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20%234%20(PA18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20%234%20(PA18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 3100mAh battery is slightly faster to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20%234%20(BE18650-26).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20%234%20(BE18650-26)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing down to 2600mAh reduces the charge time slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20%231%20(AW18350-IMR).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20%231%20(AW18350-IMR)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was very curious about the charge current in the short slots, the specifications changed between 300mA and 500mA depending on where I read it (Box:500mA, charger:300mA). A 300mA charge current would be fine for 10440, but 500mA is too high.<br>\r\nAs can be seen on the curve the charger uses 500mA.<br>\r\nThe termination current is the same as the long slots, i.e. around 100mA, this is too high for smaller batteries and will prevent them from being fully charged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Soshine/SC-S1mix%20V3/SC-S1mix%20%232%20(AW18350-IMR).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"SC-S1mix%20%232%20(AW18350-IMR)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second short slot is the same. This battery was below 3.25 volt when starting to charge and the charger uses a lower current, until 3.25 volt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTesting the mains transformer with 2500 volt and 5000 volt between mains and low volt side, did not show any safety problems. The EU plug converter is a safety hazard, as they always are (Buying the charger from a EU source will probably get a real EU adapter). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is not as universal as it is supposed to be. The short slots uses too high current and are too short for 14500 and the slider does not slide smoothly.<br>\r\nWith the acceptable sizes the charger does a very good job with CC/CV charge, but with a few modifications it would have worked for more battery sizes. The missing support (or too high current using a long slot) for 14500 and too high current for 10440 does reduce the usability significantly for this charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll test was done at 110 VAC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
