It has a usb pass through connector, making it possible to charge a battery and a phone without moving wires around. With the switch it is possible to select what get charged first: battery or phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe automatic charge current selection is nice, but will select low current when not needed (Like 18500).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know a couple of times where I would have liked the pass through function, but I would usual also like a power bank function at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring test the usb output died and I am not aware of doing anything to the charger that could kill this function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a good charger (If it works), but I wonder how useful the pass through function is and it has to be made more robust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger was supplied by a Nitecore for review when the usb output died on it I bought another one where I did get some of the usb measurement before it died and on this charger 0.5A charge current did not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pov70yVEiwQ\">Nitecore has made a video explaning the function of the charger/usb output.</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
