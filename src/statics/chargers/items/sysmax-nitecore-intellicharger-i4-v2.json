This charger looks impressive when reading the specifications, it can charge nearly all types of round cells and do up to four cells at a time. The current version is an updated version of the i4 charger <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20SysMax%20i4%20UK.html\">I first reviewed</a>, where most of my issues is supposed to be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/DSC_1554.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1554\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/DSC_1555.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1555\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/DSC_1591.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1591\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger comes in a cardboard box with a view to the charger and a feature list on the front.

(See my <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/Common18650Summary%20UK.html\">18650 LiIon comparison</a> for length of different brands).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 26650/26500/C cells there can be a problem, if they have a small button top, but the problem is much less than the V1 charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 10440 LiIon cells the charge current is too high and Sysmax/NiteCore recommend always to charge two batteries together, to reduce the current. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Measurements</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger has two charger channels, one channel is handling slot #1 and #3, the other channel is handling slot #2 and #4. When charging cells in both slots for a channel, time division is used to distribute the charge (See scope traces).   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow 0.74 volt the charger will report error (all 3 yellow leds are flashing), but a small current will flow (about 500uA), this is enough to reset a LiIon protection circuit.<br>\r\nBetween 0.74 volt and 2.2 volt charger will use the NiMH charge algorithm (See curve below).<br>\r\nBetween 2.2 volt and 4.2 volt the charger will use the LiIon charge algorithm (See curve below).<br>\r\nThere is no trickle charging on either NiMH or LiIon. <br>\r\nThe charge stops LiIon charging when the current is below 44 mA, when the charger is finishes the current goes below 120uA (This is a nearly insignificant current).  <br>\r\nThe charger will not restart charging when the cell voltage drops.<br>\r\nWhen a battery is put into the charger, it will start charging and first stop when final charge condition is reached.<br>\r\nWhen power is connected the charger will start charging and first stop when final charge condition is reached.<br>\r\nWhen charger is disconnected from power, but with a battery in, it will draw less than 220 uA from a LiIon battery and less than 50uA with NiMH, current draw from each battery will be reduced when there are more batteries in the charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:16px;\">Test with LiIon cells</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/NiteCore%20i4%20(IO18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"NiteCore%20i4%20(IO18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charge curve shows a very good CC/CV charge curve, the termination current is perfect for many 18650 at 44 mA and very useable for smaller batteries.

Due to the high impedance of the old cell, the charger goes into CV phase nearly immediately.<br>\r\nThis curve starts the CV phase at a lower voltage than above, this is strange and probably means that the CC/CV curve is computer controlled and not implemented as a current limited constant voltage generator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/NiteCore%20i4%20%232%20(IO18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"NiteCore%20i4%20%232%20(IO18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChannel #2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/NiteCore%20i4%20%233%20(IO18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"NiteCore%20i4%20%233%20(IO18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChannel #3<br>\r\nNote: The oscillations in the average current is probably due to my measuring setup and not present on the charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/NiteCore%20i4%20%234%20(IO18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"NiteCore%20i4%20%234%20(IO18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChannel #4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/NiteCore%20i4%20(4xIO18650-31).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"NiteCore%20i4%20(4xIO18650-31)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four slots at the same time. The charge time is longer because the two charge channels need to share current between the four slots.

I uses ++ for the really good things. things.<br>\r\n++ The charger uses a CC/CV algorithm.<br>\r\n++ The slots are long enough, all protected 18650 will fit.<br>\r\n+ The charger can be used on 12 volt.<br>\r\n+ Good indicator lights with estimation of charge in cells.<br>\r\n+ Can reset a LiIon protection circuit.<br>\r\n+ The slider has good connection with anything from 16340 to 18650 cells.<br>\r\n+ The charger is universal voltage, i.e. it can work on both 110/115/220/230 VAC.<br>\r\n- The charge current is too high for 10440 cells.<br>\r\n- The NiMH charge mode prevents correct handling of over discharged LiIon (This is unavoidable in a multi chemistry charger with automatic selection).<br>\r\n- The slider does not always move easily, when putting long cells in the charger.<br>\r\n- The NiMH charging algorithm does not use -dv/dt termination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis charger uses a CC/CV charging profile, this is the recommended way to charge LiIon batteries. The charge current is a good compromise for handling many battery sizes with only one current setting. <br>\r\nThe charger also does a good job on NiMH batteries, but I wonder about the termination.<br>\r\nI will call it a good universal charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThermo images has been added later and is not including in the general evaluation of the charger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger was supplied by SysMax for a review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll tests are done at 230 VAC mains supply, except when otherwise specified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the V1 review there was a pattern in the current, this was because my sample rate was exactly 1 second and made interference with the 2 second pulsing. In this test I have changed the sample rate to 0.9 second and mostly avoided the interference (It does show up in the \"average current\" as oscillations).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>", "url": "https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20SysMax%20i4%20V2%20UK.html", "preview": "https://lygte-info.dk/pic/SysMax/Charger%20i4v2/DSC_1583.jpg", "title": "SysMax/NiteCore Intellicharger i4 V2", "slug": "sysmax-nitecore-intellicharger-i4-v2", "slots": 4, "slots_max_size": 1, "battery_len_min": 34, "battery_len_max": 70, "battery_d_min": 10, "battery_d_max": 26, "current_all": 0.3, "current_single_max": 0.7, "current_single_min": 0.7, "chemistry": ["NiMH", "LiIon 4.2V"], "power": ["12V", "Mains"], "extra": [], "rating": 6, "year": 2012}
