In addition to the charger one or two loose cables are also needed. The charging works fine for good batteries.<br>\r\nIt also works fine as a power bank, but the coding is a bit optimistic compare to its abilities. The noise is low. The charger do not handle it well when the battery is running low (The battery will not be damaged).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will rate it as good for charger, and fairly good for power bank functionality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/usbPowerSupplyTestHow%20UK.html\">How do i test usb charger and power banks</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>", "url": "https://lygte-info.dk/review/Review%20Charger%20The%20minimum%20charger%20UK.html", "preview": "https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Other/Charger%20The%20minimum%20charger/DSC_1256.jpg", "title": "The minimum charger", "slug": "the-minimum-charger", "slots": 1, "slots_max_size": 1, "battery_len_min": 35, "battery_len_max": 70, "battery_d_min": 18, "battery_d_max": 18, "current_all": 1.8, "current_single_max": 1.8, "current_single_min": 1.8, "chemistry": [], "power": ["USB"], "extra": ["Power Bank", "USB charger"], "rating": 6, "year": 2019}
