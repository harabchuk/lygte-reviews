This model here is the smallest and cheapest version, or would have been if I had selected \"silver\" instead of red. You can get this charger with a couple of different charge currents, I have selected the lowest standard current (i.e. 100mA), the highest current is 700mA for this model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3105.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3105\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3106.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3106\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the charger together with an general instrution sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3108.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3108\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotice the small hole just outside the label, there is a red led behind this hole.<br>\r\nThis led is red while charging and flashing red when power is connected but no battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3110.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3110\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3109.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3109\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger is practial, but the finish is not perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3126.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3126\"><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/DSC_3112.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_3112\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battery connection is with magnets, this means the charger can be connection to any size battery, but for larger batteries a lot of patience is neaded with a 100mA charge current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/supportedBatteryTypes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatteryTypes\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/supportedBatterySizes.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"supportedBatterySizes\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger can be used for many sizes of LiIon cells, but due to the low charge current and termination current it is best suited for cells below 500mAh to 1000mAh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Measurements</span><br>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Without power connected there is about 1.2uA current draw from the battery.\r\n</li><li>With power connected there is also about 1.2uA current draw from the battery.\r\n</li><li>Below 2.9 volt the charge current is 14mA, above it will charge at full current.\r\n</li><li>Power cycling or battery reinsertion will not restart charging.\r\n</li><li>The charger will restart when the battery voltage drops to 3.9 volt.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/100mA%20basic%20(AW18350-IMR).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"100mA%20basic%20(AW18350-IMR)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith 100mA charge current I did not want to test any larger batteries, I stayed with the smaller sizes.<br>\r\nThe 18350 get a perfect CC/CV charge, with a termination current of 10mA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/CottonPickers/100mA%20basic/100mA%20basic%20(AW16340-IMR).png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"100mA%20basic%20(AW16340-IMR)\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy old IMR16340 cell did also charge perfectly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charger does a very good CC/CV charge and is very good for charging small LiIon batteries in the 100mA version.<br>\r\nI do not expect the higher current models to have the same nice CC/CV, they will probably run at reduced current the first part of the charge cycle (Due to heat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an explanation on how I did the above charge curves: <a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/How%20do%20I%20test%20a%20charger%20UK.html\">How do I test a charger</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
