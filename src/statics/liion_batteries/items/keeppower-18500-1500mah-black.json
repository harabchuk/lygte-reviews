The smaller size means considerable less capacity and less maximum current. This battery is only 1500mAh and does hold the capacity, even at a 5A load (Probably because the cell used is 1600mAh).<br>\r\nThe internal resistance is higher than a 18650, but that is expected from a smaller battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/DSC_1535.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1535\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/DSC_1537.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1537\"> <img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/DSC_1538.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1538\"><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/DSC_1539.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1539\"><br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/DSC_1540.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"DSC_1540\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Capacity.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Capacity\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-CapacityTimeHours.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-CapacityTimeHours\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-CapacityTime.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-CapacityTime\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Energy.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Energy\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-PowerLoadTime.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-PowerLoadTime\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-TripCurrent.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-TripCurrent\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a battery with 3A rating the trip current is a bit high. The actual resistance in the operating range is slightly lower than my measurement shows. My measurement is calculated at the high load current and there the red trace drops extra fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://lygte-info.dk/pic/Batteries2012/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)/Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Charge.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Keeppower%2018500%201500mAh%20(Black)-Charge\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is not much to say about this battery, with a Sanyo cell inside, I will call it a very good battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes and links</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeppower is a OEM manufacturer, i.e. many of the batteries they produce is sold with other names on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batteries was supplied by Keeppower for review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/Batteries2012Info%20UK.html\">How is the test done and how to read the charts</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/battery%20protection%20UK.html\">How is a protected LiIon battery constructed</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://lygte-info.dk/info/Battery%20button%20or%20flat%20UK.html\">More about button top and flat top batteries</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</body>",
