As load I either used a resistor (All tests with ohms) or a electronic load (All tests with current).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Power discussion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen looking at power consumption it is necessary to look at how different devices draw power:<ul>\r\n<li>Constant resistance, this is simple resistor. When the voltage drops the current draw will drop. This usual means the device will slow down or in some other way reduce performance. Using the sleeve will increase the voltage and probably increase the performance of the device. The penalty is shorter runtime for the battery. \r\n</li><li>Constant current, this will match a device with a linear voltage regulator. In some cases the sleeve may give more runtime for this type of devices.\r\n</li><li>Constant power, this match most modern electronic device, it has a boost convert build in and will adjust current draw to always supply the needed voltage and power. If the build in boost converter is anywhere near decent quality the sleeve will waste 10% power and not do anything else. In some devices the build in boost converter may not work at low voltage and the sleeve will increase the runtime if added when the battery is empty (Adding it before adds a 10% waste).\r\n</li></ul>\r\nMost devices will not be one of the above, but a combination where one of the types is dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Conclusion</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeve is not really a product to save a lot of batteries with, there are probably a few products where it will increase the runtime for batteries, if it can fit in them (Many devices has a fairly tight fit on batteries).<br>\r\nWith some devices there is also a risk that either the ripple or the switcher noise will prevent them from working correctly.<br>\r\nDue to the nearly constant output voltage until the battery is empty, battery meters will not really work when using this device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo find devices where it might be useful, look for devices that have very short runtime with NiMH batteries and considerable longer with alkaline. The sleeve might be more useful with NiMH batteries than with alkaline. The question is how hard the 0.6V minimum will affect lifetime of NiMH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a general device to extend battery life it is not very useful, but in a <b>very few</b> situations it might be a useable solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:25px;\">Notes and links</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a battery out of a device that has stopped working and measuring the voltage on the battery will <b>not</b> show at what voltage the device stops working, but a much higher voltage.
